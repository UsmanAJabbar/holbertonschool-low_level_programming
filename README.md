# Holberton School - Lower-Level Programming
This repository contains all the logic files necessary for the Holberton School curriculum.

This repository represents my journey from having no experience coding nothing in C, to actually coding in it regularly. This repository, like many other, may contain easter eggs and comments to keep the code engaging and refresher after revisiting it a few more months down the line.

This repository is largely dominated by code in C, along with all the headers necessary to make code work.

# General Pre-requisites
- All projects in this repository are expected to be coded in the terminal.
- All of the code in this repository had to be Betty-compliant, a C-code style linter that ensures code adheres to certain Holberton School style standards.
